# League of Legends Damage Calculator

## FAQ(JK nobody asked but still wanted to put this here to clarify somethings)

### Q: Why am I able to select multiple keystones and minor nodes on the same row?
#### A: Because the target audience is player's that play league and it allows for easier comparison. Also the rune pages are one of the few features left from the very first iteration of the app that I have not touched due to laziness and such. (Will update this to be more strict when/if there is a major runes overhaul or a big update to the game resulting me needing to change multiple parts to remain accurate)

### Q: X champion/item/etc is missing/not up to date.
#### A: Coming soon... unless I don't know it exsists then probably not.

### Q: It looks weird.
#### A: My screen is a bit desaturated. The background image is the league in game loading screen and I just took the colors from that image and made it darker/lighter. If you're talking about the layout/design etc I'm not a designer. Feedback appreciated.

### Q: Is this completed?
#### A: It is fully functioning. It's not the final version but I only plan to add more features whenever there is a large update in league, it will be updated every 2 weeks or so to keep up to date with the most recent patch.

### Q: What rank are you?
#### A: Iron 5 trying to get to Iron 4 by the end of s11. 

### Q: Dragon buffs stacks up to 4 times.
#### A: Yes.

### Q: Why does the dragon buff only go up to 2 in the damage calc?
#### A: Yes.

### Q: The damage for X is Y in game but shows Z in the damage calc.
#### A: Most likely an oversight on my part. There are more champions than there are pokemon in the kanto dex, I did not go over each one to verify the results of the calculations, I dont even own half the champions. The abilities of the champions I have checked seems correct, check ability notes if any to see what that damage number is for.

Most of the inaccurate skills are missing their current/missing hp damage portion, other than the solution of just adding those 2 to the damage calc they will have a description of what they're missing and the number that is shown is the "min" damage the skill would do. (Q: Why not add a slider A: la.. currently working on other things.)
